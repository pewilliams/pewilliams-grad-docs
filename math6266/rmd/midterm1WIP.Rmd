#### Section 1.1

*Exercise 3. Consider the linear regression model from exercise 1. Suppose, that the target of
estimation is $h^{\intercal}\theta$ for some determinate non-zero vector $h\in R^p$. Find expression for the LSE of $h^{\intercal}\theta$. Is this estimate optimal in sense of Gauss-Markov theorem, i.e. does it have the smallest
variance among all linear unbiased estimators?*

---Start with this ---By Gauss Markov, we know that a BLUE estimator has $Var(\theta_{OLS}) = \sigma^2(XX^{\intercal})^{-1})$. However in the case of heterscedastic noise, we have $Var(\theta) = (XX^{\intercal})^{-1}X D X^{\intercal}(XX^{\intercal})^{-1}$, which must be greater than $\sigma^2 (XX^{\intercal})^-1)$. An so, in this case, our estimator is not BLUE. Study the same issue for the target $\eta = H^{\intercal}\theta$, where 
$H \in R^{q \times p}$ is some non-zero matrix with $q \leq p$.

#### Section 1.3

*Exercise 6. Let $L1, L2$ be some subspaces in $R^n$, and $L2 \subseteq L1 \subseteq R^n$. Let $PL1, PL2$ denote orthogonal projections on these subspaces. Prove the following properties:*  
*(a) $PL2 - PL1$ is an orthogonal projection,*  
*(b) $|PL2| \leq |PL1|\  \forall x \in R^n$,*  
*(c) $PL2 \cdot PL1 = PL2$*  

#### Section 2.1
*Exercise 7.*
*(a) Using the notation from section 2.1, consider $X \sim N(\mu,I_n)$ for some $\mu \in R^n$. Find $E(Q(X))$ and $Var(Q(X))$*
 
For $Q(X) = \sum_i\sum_j a_{ij}X_iX_j=X^{\intercal}AX, X\sim N(\mu,I_n)$, we have, using the property of trace operator:
$$E(Q(X)) = tr(E(Q(X)) = E(tr(Q(X)) = E(tr(X^{\intercal}AX)) = E(tr(AXX^{\intercal})) = tr(AE(XX^{\intercal}))$$
Since $E(XX^\intercal) = I_n + \mu\mu^{\intercal}$, we have,
$$tr(AE(XX^{\intercal})) = tr(A(I_n + \mu\mu^{\intercal})) = trA + tr(A\mu\mu^{\intercal}) = trA + \mu^{\intercal}A\mu$$
$Var(Q(X)) =$
 
*(b) Generalize the results from part (a) to the case $X \sim N(\mu,\Sigma)$ for some positive-definite covariance matrix $\Sigma \in R^{n \times n}$.*
For $X\sim N(\mu,\Sigma)$ we have,
$$E(Q(X)) = tr(AE(XX^{\intercal})) = tr(A(\Sigma + \mu\mu^{\intercal})) = tr(A\Sigma) + tr(A\mu\mu^{\intercal}) = tr(A\Sigma) + \mu^{\intercal}A\mu$$
$Var(Q(X)) =$
 
#### Section 2.2

*Exercise 9. In the Gaussian linear regression model 3, consider the target of estimation $\eta = H^{\intercal} \theta^*$ , where $H \in R^{q \times p}$ is some non-zero matrix with $q \leq p$. Find an analogue of the quadratic form $S2$ (from (4)) for the new target $\eta^{\ast}$, and prove for the new quadratic form statements similar to (e) from Theorem 2.1, and Corollary 2.1.2.*

*Exercise 11. Find an elliptical confidence set for the expected response $E[Y]$ in model (3).* 

*Exercise 12. Construct simultaneous confidence intervals (e.g., as in Corollary 2.2.1) for the
expected responses $E[Y_1], . . . , E[Y_n]$ in model (3).*
